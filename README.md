# LINQ Shuffle

- Used LINQ queries to aggregate suit and rank sequences into a card sequence
- Wrote Extension methods to add custom functionality to LINQ queries (i.e. InterleaveSequenceWith, SequenceEqual, LogQuery)
- Learned about areas in code where LINQ queries encounter performance issues like slow speed
- Learned about Lazy and Eager evaluation in regards to LINQ queries and their implications on query performance
